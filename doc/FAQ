 Problem: Cannot run with python2.2
   Cause: Python Bindings pygtk have not been installed in python 2.2 library
Solution: Download the latest pygtk from: ftp://ftp.gtk.org/pub/gtk/python/v1.2/
          After unpacking, in the unpacked directory, type:
             PYTHON=/usr/bin/python2 ./configure --prefix=/usr
             make
             make install
	     
          Also, if your python2.2 is started by typing python2 then the first
	  line of the gonvert file must be:
	     #!/usr/bin/python2
          Use "which python2" to find the exact path that starts python2.



 Problem: gonvert reports "ImportError:  No module named gnome.ui"
   Cause: Python programs that use the gnome interface require pygnome
Solution: install pygnome which can be obtained from:
	  ftp://ftp.daa.com.au/pub/james/python/


Q: Where is the source?
A: This is a Python program, the program is the source code.
   Use a text viewer/editor to look directly at gonvert
